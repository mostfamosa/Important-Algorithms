# Important Algorithms Every Engineer Should Know!

## Binary Search Visualization

This project is a simple web application that visualizes the binary search algorithm using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to input a sorted array and a target value, and then visualizes each step of the binary search algorithm to demonstrate how the algorithm works.

### Features

- Allows the user to input a sorted array and a target value
- Visualizes each step of the binary search algorithm
- Highlights the elements being compared and the target value
- Provides messages to indicate when the target value is found or not found in the array
